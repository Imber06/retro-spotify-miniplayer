# retro-spotify-miniplayer
This project was built in the game Retro Gadgets. The gadget interacts with the Spotify Web API to pull your music data and control playback with play, pause, skip, and volume controls. 

Since each instance of this project will be locally hosted on Retro Gadgets by the user, there's no way for me to make this an actual application, so instead I've added a set of instructions here so that you can get it up and running for yourself.
You'll need to own Retro Gadgets (you can find it on Steam), you'll need to be on a Windows machine, and you'll need a Spotify account (preferably one with Premium, as I don't know how ads will interact with the miniplayer).

Additionally, my lua file uses json.lua, created by rxi and available on Github. You can find it [here](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua/blob/master/json.lua).
